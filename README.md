# Safe-Walk

## Inspiration
Penn State offers a safe walk program "designed to provide walking accompaniment" for anyone that does not feel comfortable or safe walking alone. However, this program is only a phone number for people to call and request service. While this service is great in theory, it lacks accessibility and ease of use. We set to fix the issues this hotline does not address.

## What it does
SafeWalk provides users with a certified person to ensure safe walking to or from various locations. Upon opening the application, the user's current location is collected and will be sent to an assigned walker. The user can then select a destination for their walk and the application will find an appropriate walker for that journey. Walkers are volunteers from Penn State employees that must complete an additional background check before getting the position. Once paired with a walker, the user may look at their walker's profile and either accept or reject that walker. If accepted, the walker's location will display to the user. After the walk is completed, the user will be able to submit a rating for their assigned walker.

## What's next for Safe Walk
In the future, we hope to expand this project further than Penn State. First by going to other universities that have well-established and trustworthy staff to ensure quality walkers. Furthermore, we will add an additional safety feature where if the user differs from the walking path, other staff will be notified of the departure.
